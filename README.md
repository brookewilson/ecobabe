This repository contains the data processing script and select output files for the microbiome analysis of the ECOBABe trial.

The ECOBABe Trial was a single-blinded randomised placebo-controlled pilot trial that assessed whether oral administration of maternal vaginal microbes could restore gut microbiome development in infants born by caesarean section (CS). 

The trial recruited 25 infants born by CS and randomised them 1:1 to receive a 3 ml solution of maternal vaginal microbes (CS-seeded, n=12) or sterile water (CS-placebo, n=13). A group of vaginally born infants served as a reference control (VB, n=22). 

Shotgun metagenomics was performed on a total of 116 samples. This included 45 infant stool samples collected at 1 month of age, 46 infant stool samples collected at 3 months of age, and 25 maternal vaginal samples (from CS mothers).
